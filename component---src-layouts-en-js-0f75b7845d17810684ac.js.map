If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/curryN.js\n// module id = 12\n// module chunks = 27447698812214 34471704633725","module.exports = function _has(prop, obj) {\n  return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop);\n};\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/internal/_has.js\n// module id = 14\n// module chunks = 27447698812214 34471704633725","var _curry2 = require('./internal/_curry2');\nvar _dispatchable = require('./internal/_dispatchable');\nvar _map = require('./internal/_map');\nvar _reduce = require('./internal/_reduce');\nvar _xmap = require('./internal/_xmap');\nvar curryN = require('./curryN');\nvar keys = require('./keys');\n\n\n/**\n * Takes a function and\n * a [functor](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor),\n * applies the function to each of the functor's values, and returns\n * a functor of the same shape.\n *\n * Ramda provides suitable `map` implementations for `Array` and `Object`,\n * so this function may be applied to `[1, 2, 3]` or `{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`.\n *\n * Dispatches to the `map` method of the second argument, if present.\n *\n * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.\n *\n * Also treats functions as functors and will compose them together.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category List\n * @sig Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n * @param {Function} fn The function to be called on every element of the input `list`.\n * @param {Array} list The list to be iterated over.\n * @return {Array} The new list.\n * @see R.transduce, R.addIndex\n * @example\n *\n *      var double = x => x * 2;\n *\n *      R.map(double, [1, 2, 3]); //=> [2, 4, 6]\n *\n *      R.map(double, {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}); //=> {x: 2, y: 4, z: 6}\n * @symb R.map(f, [a, b]) = [f(a), f(b)]\n * @symb R.map(f, { x: a, y: b }) = { x: f(a), y: f(b) }\n * @symb R.map(f, functor_o) = functor_o.map(f)\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(_dispatchable(['fantasy-land/map', 'map'], _xmap, function map(fn, functor) {\n  switch (Object.prototype.toString.call(functor)) {\n    case '[object Function]':\n      return curryN(functor.length, function() {\n        return fn.call(this, functor.apply(this, arguments));\n      });\n    case '[object Object]':\n      return _reduce(function(acc, key) {\n        acc[key] = fn(functor[key]);\n        return acc;\n      }, {}, keys(functor));\n    default:\n      return _map(fn, functor);\n  }\n}));\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/map.js\n// module id = 16\n// module chunks = 27447698812214 34471704633725","var _curry2 = require('./internal/_curry2');\nvar _equals = require('./internal/_equals');\n\n\n/**\n * Returns `true` if its arguments are equivalent, `false` otherwise.

After this only fields \"between\" sets are compared.\n *\n * B) Also, if any fragment is referenced in a selection set, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the original set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment.\n *\n * C) Also, if multiple fragments are referenced, then comparisons\n * are made \"between\" each referenced fragment.\n *\n * D) When comparing \"between\" a set of fields and a referenced fragment, first\n * a comparison is made between each field in the original set of fields and\n * each field in the the referenced set of fields.\n *\n * E) Also, if any fragment is referenced in the referenced selection set,\n * then a comparison is made \"between\" the original set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment (recursively referring to step D).\n *\n * F) When comparing \"between\" two fragments, first a comparison is made between\n * each field in the first referenced set of fields and each field in the the\n * second referenced set of fields.\n *\n * G) Also, any fragments referenced by the first must be compared to the\n * second, and any fragments referenced by the second must be compared to the\n * first (recursively referring to step F).\n *\n * H) When comparing two fields, if both have selection sets, then a comparison\n * is made \"between\" both selection sets, first comparing the set of fields in\n * the first selection set with the set of fields in the second.\n *\n * I) Also, if any fragment is referenced in either selection set, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the other set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment.\n *\n * J) Also, if two fragments are referenced in both selection sets, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the two fragments.\n *\n */\n\n// Find all conflicts found \"within\" a selection set, including those found\n// via spreading in fragments.
